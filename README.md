A 2D Space Shooter Game in C and SDL

The aim of this project is to port Penguin Warrior by John Hall (@overcode) [http://nostarch.com/plg.htm](http://nostarch.com/plg.htm) to SDL 1.2 to SDL 2.0.

After this, porting to Android (supported in 2.0), and to JavaScript using [emscripten](https://github.com/kripken/emscripten/wiki) will be easier.
